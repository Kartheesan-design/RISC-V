# RISC-V

MIPS - Million instructions per second
ISA - Instruction set architecture 

=> The term instruction set architecture denotes the instructions that are visible to the assembly language programmer—the number of registers, the addressing modes, and the operations (opcodes) available in the        particular processor.

# Memory Access Instructions

The only instructions in the MIPS ISA to access the memory are load and store
instructions. A load instruction transfers data from memory to the specified register. A store instruction transfers data from a register to the specified memory
address

The design must contain a unit to fetch the instructions, a unit to decode
the instructions, an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) to execute the instructions, a
register file to hold the operands, and the memory that stores instructions and data.
